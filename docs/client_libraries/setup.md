# Client Setup

Before an application creates a producer/consumer, the  client library needs to initiate a setup phase including two steps:

* The client attempts to determine the owner of the topic by sending a Lookup request to Broker.  
* Once the client library has the broker address, it creates a RPC connection (or reuses an existing connection from the pool) and (in later stage authenticates it ).
* Within this connection, the clients (producer, consumer) and brokers exchange RPC commands. At this point, the client sends a command to create producer/consumer to the broker, which will comply after doing some validation checks.

=== "Rust"

    ```rust
    use danube_client::DanubeClient;

    #[tokio::main]
    async fn main() -> Result<()> {
        // Setup tracing
        tracing_subscriber::fmt::init();

        let client = DanubeClient::builder()
            .service_url("http://[::1]:6650")
            .build()
            .unwrap();
    }
    ```

=== "Go"

    ```go
    import "github.com/danube-messaging/danube-go"

    func main() {

        client := danube.NewClient().ServiceURL("127.0.0.1:6650").Build()

    }
    ```
